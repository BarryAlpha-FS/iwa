        Game uses a standard health points system, with a limited amount of
health reflected by a health bar. Medkits scattered throughout the
        levels or dropped by some foes are used to restore health when the

      <h1>Game</h1>
      <p>
        is a 2003 first-person shooter game developed by Infinity Ward and
        published by Activision. It is the first installment in the Call of Duty
        franchise,[3] released on October 29, 2003, for Microsoft Windows. The
        game simulates infantry and combined arms warfare of World War II using
        a modified version of the id Tech 3 engine. Much of its theme and
        gameplay is similar to the Medal of Honor series; however, Call of Duty
        showcases multiple viewpoints staged in the American, British, and
        Soviet campaigns of World War II in Europe.

<h2>Call of Duty</h2>
<p>
The game introduced a new take on AI-controlled allies who support the
        player during missions and react to situational changes during gameplay.
        This led to a greater emphasis on squad-based play as opposed to the
        "lone wolf" approach often portrayed in earlier first-person shooter
        games. Much of Infinity Ward's development team consisted of members who
        helped develop Medal of Honor: Allied Assault. The game received
        critical acclaim and won several Game of the Year awards from reviewers.

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
As a first-person shooter, Call of Duty places the player in control of
an infantry soldier who makes use of various authentic World War II
firearms in combat. Each mission features a series of objectives that
are marked on the heads-up display's compass; the player must complete
all objectives to advance to the next mission. The player can save and
load at any time, rather than the checkpoint system utilized in later
Call of Duty games. The player has two primary weapon slots, a handgun
slot, and can carry up to ten grenades. Weapons may be exchanged with
those found on the battlefield dropped by dead soldiers. Unlike later
Call of Duty games, the first allows the player to toggle between
different firing modes (single shot or automatic fire). Call of Duty was
 one of the early first-person shooters to feature iron sights in game
play; by pressing the corresponding key the player aims down the gun's
actual sights for increased accuracy. In addition to weapons carried by
the player, mounted machine guns and other fixed weapon emplacements are
controllable by the player
